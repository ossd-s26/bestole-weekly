## What Open Source Means to Me

Open source in my opinion stands in direct opposition to capital and what tech giants like palentir and "Open" AI are furthering. The usage of open source allows information to be available to all, instead of privatized to further the profits of tech billionaires. In my opinion, focusing on open source is essential in a time where privatization of information for the sake of capital is becoming worse with each year. I've always been interested in open source and am hoping that I am able to make some contributions to my favorite open source project, LUTE, during this class. 

## Open Source Projects I Use

### React
I've used React for a few projects for school/myself and find its ease of use and ability to create components extremely useful for smaller projects. 

### VSCode
I have been using VSCode as my daily editor for the past 3 years for everything execept Java. The ability to add extensions (which can also be open source) make it a very versatile editor, and my favorite to use so far.
### LUTE
LUTE - learning using texts - is an open source reading platform for langauge learning. I have used it daily for the past year to learn french. Many other platforms like LUTE (basically all of them) are paid or free to use but with restrictions.
