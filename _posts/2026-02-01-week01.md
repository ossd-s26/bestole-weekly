title: Week 2: Thoughts on Codes of Conduct

## Benefits and Comparisons of Codes of Conduct

A code of conduct like the one provided by [Go](https://go.dev/conduct) ensures that a community or any given contributor to an open source project have a designated set of rules and expectations to follow. It provides a neccessary illusion of safety regardless of a person's sex, race, religion etc.. I feel like every project should have a code of conduct that protects the (very diverse) contributors of the worldwide open source community.

We can find another example of a code of conduct provided by [the Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4/code-of-conduct/). Two main differences I find between the code of conduct provided by the Contributor Covenant and Go's code of conduct are the language/expression used in each and purpose. While reading through the code of conduct of the Contributor Covenant it felt more like a document to protect the project rather than the contributors working on it. The language and formatting seemed much more corporate to that of Go. The Contributor Covenant made their code of conduct like that as it serves as a "base" code of conduct which open source projects can modify as needed. The Go project might have made these changes (casual language and focus on the community) in an attempt to foster a warmer / more casual sense of community for their project, rather than use the boilerplate code of conduct provided by the Contributor Covenant.

[Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/org/documents/Community_Code_of_Conduct.php) also has a code of conduct that seems more rigid than that of Go's. The base is the same as Go's (the Contributor Convenant), but it seems they took less creative liberties in changing the code of conduct to fit their needs. 

Another code of conduct provided by [Sugar Labs](https://wiki.sugarlabs.org/go/Sugar_Labs/Legal/Code_of_Conduct) is interesting because it differs from the last three that we looked in that as it has a different base code of conduct. It is based on the [Ubuntu Code of Conduct](https://ubuntu.com/community/docs/ethos/code-of-conduct). This code of conduct seems much more casual and doesn't use as many bullet points (preferring paragraphs of text). This leads to more of a blog style reading of the code of conduct rather than a set of rules to follow. It is interesting that they refer to their code of conduct also as "legal," which none of the past three have done.

My favorite open source project right now, LUTE (or learning using texts), does not have a code of conduct. There is, however, a [guide on contributing](https://github.com/LuteOrg/lute-v3/wiki/Contributing) which serves a very similar purpose. It is obvious that this contribution guide does not source either of the two base code of conducts we looked at. It is interesting to see that the code of conduct is split in a certain manner, as the guide on contributing is on the github; however, the rules with how to engage with the community are located on the project's discord.

Finally, this week I watched a video from an Open Source conference called [How to Drive Consensus and Transparency Within Open Source Communities](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYwTDNA3Uac). I found that a lot of similar ideas were mentioned in the video i.e. how to operate well within a community. The part which I found the most useful was the advice given on how to allow people to have their voice heard in Open Source. They mentioned thinking about time zones, alternate languages, language ability (some people prefer to type rather than talk), and I realized I had not even considered most of these problems. The open source community is genuinely worldwide, and it is not a simple task to allow everyone to have an equal opportunity to be heard.
